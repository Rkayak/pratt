We had an amazing day on the water, leaving Lagoon Cove at 6:14 a.m., with Bill and Bob's help getting away from the dock from in

between two, 50+ foot, boats with a light breeze pushing us towards one of them. A third fellow showed up and stepped on to the swim

platform of the other boat to help keep us pushed off until we had enough room to maneuver safely away. Thanks fellows. 

<br />

Then we went down Chatham Channel with a nice current our direction and cruised on down to the Broken Islands averaging from 9.2 

to 9.4 knots per hour. High tide was around 7:30 a.m. and then the current would change and be against us. Well, we did 60.1 

nautical miles in seven hours and the only place where we hit current against us, was in Dent Rapids and the Devil's Hole which

has a whole attitude all to itself; and have tied up in Big Bay for the evening after arriving at 1:15 p.m. We even sailed through

Whirlpool Rapids and Green Point Rapids with no problems and either slack or moving so slow, we barely slowed. Average speed for

the day was 8.7 nautical miles per hour. Nice, very nice.

Last night the sun set behind some heavy thick clouds and it was beautiful to watch. Of course, it didn't take very long for the

rain to start pattering on our boat and of course we hustled around closing the hatches, various windows and securing the bridge

which had open canvas all over in order to decrease the heat and allow a breeze to keep the area cool around our chest freezer.

It was a wet kiss of goodbye from a wonderful place that we make sure to stop in at least twice during the summer. Plus, this is

the only fuel dock that we utilize while north of Nanaimo. Thank you again, Bill and Jean, for making us feel so warm and comfortable.

We leave Lagoon Cove in the morning, continuing our journey south. Not sure where we will be tomorrow night, but it will be 

further south and not up here where our hearts and friends remain in different ways.  

Much more has been added below including a lesson on how to safely get out of a kayak, as demonstrated by Trisha.

<br />	<br />				

Leaving Shawl Bay on the morning of the 6th, at 6:15 a.m., we decided to go down Tribune Channel and ended up with four hours

of fog traveling time, with the majority of it on instruments only, due to it setting down so thick. Dang. Only saw one commercial

boat the entire trip, and nothing else on the radar except for a HUGE school of porpoises, that we saw visually as well. What dancers!

Arriving at Lagoon Cove was such a relief, and we relaxed on the boat after the customary 'Lagoon Cove welcome', including invitation

to their 5 o'clock Happy Hour.

Before leaving Shawl Bay we had the delight of spending some time with "Aguaholic", another 38 foot Bayliner with Dick and Sandy onboard.

The story for the day begins with a 32 foot Bayliner forgetting about their submerged Crab Hotel.

Loren came over and asked them if they minded moving from dock 1 to dock 3 around one o'clock in the afternoon. Rick

and Trisha were very happy to help pack in more boats for the 'deep fried turkey potluck' and started up their motors to move. 

Unfortunately, the line in the water from their Crab Hotel went around their starboard prop, since it was hanging off the dinghy

 davit on their swim platform when they started pulling away from the dock. They limped over on one motor with some tricky manuevering between other boats and then started asking 'Is there a diver on the dock?'

Nope, no divers to be found. Wait a minute, somebody says there is an 87 year old willing to dive and it is the guy on Aguaholic!

Sandy helped Dick get out all of his diving gear, including a wet suit and since Rebecca has scuba dived in the past, she was able

to help him with some of the heavier things for getting ready. Once Dick started suiting up, the skipper on the boat with line around

the prop was also a big help and John had a multiple level of jobs as well. The weight of the BC vest, tank and built in weights

was the biggest challenge and Dick stood on the edge of the dock with flippers on, while John hoisted the outfit up and held in place

as Rebecca and a couple of other guys worked on getting the buckles flat and secured snugly. Whew! Dick took one loooonnnnng step forward

and went straight down into the water. Rebecca ended up on the swim platform to assist in adjusting his mask to stop it from leaking

around the edges and then handed Dick the necessary tool which was tied securely with a line... a bread knife! Guess the serrated edge

is the best thing for cutting lines.  Dive went smoothly and more than 30 minutes later in front of a big audience, Dick floated up

with prop clear of all line.  Of course, the first thing he did was go down, look around, come back to surface and request an extra line

to tie to the Hotel before he cut it loose.  Crab Hotel came up and the crabs demonstrated shaky legs after their experience under the water!

Trisha's visit started in Sullivan Bay and she was on the bridge as we traveled to Shawl Bay, giving her a chance to be at the helm

of our boat. Rebecca and Trisha got in some kayaking time as well, while John relaxed on the boat. Below are pictures demonstrating

how to safely get out of a kayak such as Trisha has, and you simply reverse the order to get into the kayak. Great job Trisha. As you

can see, John is the support person on board to assist in any way, including removing items so one doesn't trip and end up in the drink!

Kayaking ended up being a unique combination of

sights that included loons, different floathome living quarters and garden on a floathome. We caught a hummingbird in action in the

garden and the overall appearance of colors is wonderful to view. We also had lemon meringue pie for desert and shared it with boaters

on our dock as well. On the first time of checking our crab pot, Trisha and Rebecca pulled up a box crab. What an amazing and

different looking crab! Wow! John was also able to catch the two kayakers in the water before Trisha's departure on Friday, the 3rd.

She was a delight to have on board for four days and three nights and experienced 'summer vacation' the Rebecca Ann style. She sure

looked like she was having fun.

Yesterday, Pete and Gail Peterson, along with their grandson Chris, invited us to go fishing with them off of James Point. 

We sure had fun and ended up have the classical series of comics while trying to net and bring aboard two lingcods. 

Chris netted a nice lingcod for his grandpa, and the hook got caught in the net, meanwhile, Rebecca was bringing in her jig and hooked

an even bigger lingcod. Of course, she starts hollering for the net too.  Chris and John are trying to free up the net and get the other

lingcod and hook undone. Rebecca was fishing on the bow of the boat and was trying to move to the back in order to have her lingcod netted.

As she stepped down, she brushed Chris' fishing pole and his jig was swinging lose with a treble hook, and now it is hooked in her pants too!

Things got crazy from there, hook still stuck in net but lingcod out; John then netted Rebecca's lingcod so she would quit hollering for the net and

Pete was trying to rescue pole that was moving around with Rebecca due to hook thoroughly stuck in her pants!!! LOL!!! All fish were caught and

when you look at pictures, check for hook on the left side of Rebecca's upper left leg!

We were out checking our prawn pots, and upon our start to return into Turnbull, we were treated with the special 'dolphin dance',
most of which we didn't get on camera because we were so busy just watching them play less than 10 feet from our dinghy. They did
ride the wave right under our bow too, which we caught a couple pictures of. Beauty beyond words!

On the 16th of this month, we had an opportunity to meet a wonderful couple who hang their hats here in the BC waters, Hawaii, 

and New Zealand with their boat named 'Kaloa'. The Hawaiian name for this duck is koloa maoli and it is native to Hawaii. 

Much like the mallard duck it quacks on take off and landing. In the early 1920's up to 25 birds were killed daily and this, along 

with other issues including loss of lowland wetland habitats, and interbreeding with feral Mallard ducks. 

"Pure" Hawaiian Ducks are currently found only on Kaua'i. Anyway, Ric and Kitty have a unique boat that is very seaworthy, and 

are traveling with their son "PK while he is on a short break from school. 

In New Zealand, the calendar school year runs from February to December.

As with previous years, we caught up with Pete and Gail Peterson, and their grandson Chris, who have a floathome in Sullivan Bay. 

It's always nice to visit with them and share stories. So in-between doing laundry and some catch-up maintenance on the boat, 

we visited with interesting boaters, cooked and packaged crab, plus we were invited to go salmon fishing with Pete and Chris. In 

spite of the unsettled sea conditions Chris and Rebecca managed to land two nice coho's. As you can see by the photos Chris was 

trying to make a point as to which salmon was the largest! In all, we had a great time on the water with our friends. Gail was 

having a little problem with her laptop so Chris and John took it over to the boat and proceeded to do some much needed service. 

When we left Sullivan Bay, needless to say, Gail was very happy with the results. Rebecca put a big smile on John's face upon her 

return from paying our moorage fees, when she showed him two big sticky buns. YES!	Another interesting detail is shown in the two

Sullivan Bay pictures, on how empty the docks are this year. There are fewer floathomes, along with empty docks. Times are changing

maybe due to fuel costs.

Next adventure, while Alex, Kris and Dennis were still with us, was to visit Larry and Trisha Mullinnix in Big Nimmo Bay. They move 

their floathome from Little Nimmo Bay, where it is secured during the wintertime at Nimmo Lodge, using their Mully Lee to travel 

approximately 1.2 nuatical miles. They have anchors in place to secure for summertime, and hook up to water on shore.

We left on Alex's boat, the "K2" from Turnbull Cove, to go down Kenneth Passage, up Mackenzie Sound, and then carefully entered 

the opening into Nimmo Bay, hanging a sharp left and then following a safe passage around rocks and away from shallow spots. It was

great to have steak, crab, and prawns as the specialties of the night. We also did a little sightseeing tour of Little Nimmo Bay

for everyone to see Nimmo Lodge. Beautiful area for people to fly in by helicopter, stay in special cabins, and heli-flight to a variety of options. 

You can find more information at www.nimmobay.com. Tomorrow, 7-19-12, we are off to Turnbull Cove. Maybe see more bears. Hope, hope, hope!

On the evening of the 4th, we were enjoying our dinner with shoreside view and here came a big black bear to join us! 

That black bear sure can turn the boulders that we can't even think of moving.

We are in Turnbull Cove and going to stay for several days. Lovely place to anchor and sit out the rain while fishing, crabbing, 

and prawning. Pictures next time we update.

				<br />

				Due to staying a second night at Shawl Bay, we met a couple traveling on their Catamaran. Sorry, no picture of their boat, but one of them! We did spend time 

visiting and sharing information with them about Kindles, actually, John was the source of this knowledge that both Darth and 

Catherine wanted to learn. From Shawl Bay we continued on to wet weather and crabbing in Claydon Bay. Not much luck there as you can

see from the dogfish in the crabpot! 3 footer inside the trap and a two footer with his head stuck inside trying to eat our bait!

As you can see in third picture to the right below, the weather is really wet. We both wore full rain gear, just to stay semi dry.

On our way from Claydon Bay, to Turnbull Cove, we swung by the Hoy Bay Indian Reservation and "borrowed" their wifi signal. 

We had our laptops on and messages ready to be sent. Our new Wave Wireless works great. After anchoring the boat in Turnbull Cove,

we did some serious fishing and caught lingcod and yelloweye. The "mizzle" had eased up and had calm water that made our fishing

time that much more enjoyable. Next day, here comes the mist and drizzle... aka... mizzle!

We went exploring in the kayaks, and enjoyed "mizzle" time on the water. That's a new word from Pat at Lagoon Cove. It is a combination of 'mist' and 'drizzle'!  Make sense? ... LOL ...

We did meet Loyal and Ann on their 41' SV named "September Time" after they came in and had to do some tricky boat handling in order to get to the dock.  

They make a wonderful team and while both are very proficient boat handlers, 

Loyal usually has Ann bring the boat to the dock while he does the hopping and skipping about of handling the lines. 

Their 14' beam made it a real challenge to pull in through a narrow passage, and then applying their brakes - on a boat that means throwing it into reverse - in order to not hit the 'Happy Hour/Pancake Breakfast' dock. 

Excellent job by both!

Garry developed some electrical problems, as shown below in the burnt wire picture, with his inverter and decided to return to 

Lagoon Cove, to figure out what he needs to do in order to solve and hopefully repair.  

We will stay an extra day at Shawl Bay, and wait to hear via email from Pat, what is Garry's final decision. 

Either fix the problem and catch up with us, or, head home. UPDATE...7-1-12, Garry has returned to Tacoma, WA. 

We will miss traveling with him this summer.

Stayed a couple of days at Lagoon Cove to do a little crabbing and relaxing. Bob, John, and Pat enjoyed watching the scenary from the fuel dock. 

This has given us time to sit down with Garry Marr, on his boat "In Search Of..." to work on our travel plans from this point on. Next stop? Hmmm.... Waddington Cove, Booker Lagoon, or Shawl Bay.  Votes are leaning towards pancake breakfast at Shawl Bay. :-)

Lagoon Cove after stopping by Octopus Islands and anchoring for a couple of days. We met up with Garry Marr, on his boat, "In Search Of" and his son Mike was waiting to catch a plane.

Garry took Mike over in the dinghy to The Honeymoon Dock, so that he could catch the plane. Interesting scenario!

When we arrived in Octopus Islands, we put out our crabpots and just relaxed after setting the hook firmly. We waited for slack the next day, before trying a little fishing.

Crabs weren't visiting, so we picked up only a few and decided to continue on to Lagoon Cove. It was an unbelievable trip from Octopus Islands, through Hole-In-The-Wall rapids, Yuculta Rapids, Gillard Passage, Dent Rapids, Green Point Rapids, Current Passage, 

and then up Johnstone Strait before going around Broken Islands, scooting up Chatham Channel and then tiptoeing through 'The Blowhole' at lowtide, all the way to Lagoon Cove. We hailed Bill and he told us where to park at the docks.  The welcoming 

committee included Bill, Bob and Pat. They are wonderfully friendly faces after a long day on the water, or short, depending on your starting and stopping points. Just missed Bill's wife, Jean.

Using Aye Tides, we caught the current going our way for the entire trip, with calm waters due to a light breeze. 

We left at 6:45 am and arrived at 1:59 pm! 

We normally travel between 7.5 and 8.5 knots, depending on current and wind. Our average speed yesterday was 9.6 knots, 

traveling 68.7 nautical miles in 7 hours and 14 minutes. Absolutely amazing!

Travel north from Prevost Harbor was good, with current going our direction from Bedwell Harbor clean through Dodd Narrows. Fueled up in Nanaimo 
and then anchored in Marks Bay. Wind is really blowing and so we decided to stay over for a day in Marks Bay. Met up with Garry Marr on his boat, 
"In Search Of", in Prevost Harbor; and his son Mike is traveling with him this year for a little while.

Traffic on the Swinnomish Channel was interesting today. We decided to take an extra day of 'doing nothing' on our trip north (especially after 
having the special treat of the long dock to ourself), as we begin figuring out where we are! and where we might be going! Ever had that 
experience? It's fun, that's for sure.
