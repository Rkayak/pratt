After searching for two years we purchased this 3818 in the Fall of 2006 from Jim and Karen Pederson. We met them at Shoal Bay, BC, while cruising in Canada, and 4 months later we bought their boat. With a 13 & 1/2 foot beam and twin 175 Hinos, we feel very comfortable in the Canadian waters that we cruise every summer. Rebecca has completely mastered the running and docking aspects of her and John handles the running gear and electronics while under way. Rebecca's hearing has deteriorated severely over the last few years and we discovered that we work much safer as a team, with these reversed roles. We have reached our level in boating needs and accommodations. Having a generator, inverter, battery bank, and an extra water tank, allows us to extend our anchorages for longer periods. Rebecca now has a complete galley to use in comfort. When you walk into the cabin of the 38 you can't help but notice the large salon with a 360 degree visibility. In the salon is a full wet bar, with an icemaker, and a fully operational helm. You step down with the galley on the starboard side and guest cabin on the port. It has an en suite bathroom with tub/shower. The master cabin features an island queen bed with its own en suite bathroom. We both agree that we have arrived.

We purchased this 3218 in 1999 and spent 7 wonderful summers, cruising north to Canada for the first time. We have always admired the classic design of the motoryacht. This was a huge step up for us, from our 2556 Ciera, but we were ready for the task. Having twin Hino diesel engines, instead of a single 5.7 liter gas engine, made maneuvering in tight areas in tricky situations much easier. Other upgrades included a propane stove and oven, refrigerator with larger freezer, more water and storage tank capacity and greatly increased salon and berth compartments. The 32' truly is a Northwest classic. This follows a similar design in our current 38' Bayliner.


## 2556 Bayliner Ciera

In 1989, we found this Ciera and continued fishing and traveling to the San Juan Islands in Washington, every summer. It was identical to the one that our friends, Barb and Trav, owned. On the 24' hardtop, we learned that having a flybridge for increased visibility was essential for safety reasons. The 9 & 1/2 foot beam gave us more stability, increased fishing room, while allowing up to three passengers on the bridge. This Bayliner's design catered to the fishermen and weekend cruisers. It is fully equipped with a refrigerator, stove, head w/shower, and room for guests. We trailered this boat, one time, from California to Washington. After that, we kept it stored indoors at the Fairgrounds in Port Townsend, WA. We became a two boat family for several years. We sadly sold her in 2008. Many fishing stories went with this vessel!


## 24' Bayliner Saratoga

This was our first Bayliner. She was purchased in May, 1985; one month before we met on the Malaspina in Alaska. Our honeymoon summer in 1986, entailed traveling the entire Sacramento River clean down to the Delta area.  The next summer, 1987, we trailered her to Port Townsend, WA and spent a couple of summers gunkholing in the San Juan Islands and fishing for salmon in Puget Sound and Admiralty Inlet areas.  We quickly realized that our primary boating waters were in Washington State and thus, started looking for a larger trailerable boat. Our first summer in the San Juan Islands, we saw a 2556 Bayliner Ciera in Shallow Bay at Sucia Island in the San Juan Islands.  The owners, Barb and Trav, invited us aboard and gave us a tour.  From this, we knew what we were looking for, but it took over a year to find our next Rebecca Ann.


## 11' AB Inflatable
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rkayak/pratt/images/NEW/ABInflatable.png" rel="lightbox[Boats]" title="11' AB Inflatable"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rkayak/pratt/images/NEW/ABInflatable.png" alt="11' AB Inflatable" width="140px" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px;"></a>
The AB inflatable, has a hard bottom, and with a 20 HP Honda 4 stroke, it is the perfect fishing machine for us. We have it equipped with the necessary electronics, fishing gear, and safety equipment. We can easily haul and transport crab and prawns traps as well as fish in our favorite spots. If you look closely you can see some samples from the sea at our feet in the inflatable.

Nothing like hog-tying that halibut to keep it from whacking us and beating on the floor with its tail, prior to getting it back to the big boat!


## 11' Livingston

The 11' Livingston with center consol is practically indestructible and doesn't tip over very easily. Equipped with 9 HP Mercury, it easily gets up on a plane with superb maneuvering. The previous owner designed a pulley system so that one person could actually pull the Livingston up onto the swim platform with ease. He also installed a motor swing arm that easily stores the engine, inside the runabout. This was our first fiberglass dinghy and it served us well. On the 24' and the 2556, we used inflatable dinghies with varying degrees of success in durability, and use.


## Stearns K13 Inflatable Kayaks

After purchasing the 32' Bayliner, one of the crew started getting restless and Cap't John found the perfect remedy to get her off the boat for exercise! The only stipulation was it had to be safe and sturdy.  Thus, the Stearns K13 inflatable kayak was brought on board. It is really stable, easily transported, and very durable. We did talk with other boaters, looking at their 1-person and 2-person kayaks, and decided on the 2-person version because it is very easily maneuvered by one person and holds a steady course while being paddled.

Over the years we have tried different paddles and have settled on the Aqua Bound Carbon Sting Ray Fiberglass 230 cm. Light weight, extra length is perfect for the width of an inflatable kayak, and the blades work the water with ease, and no extra effort for the paddler.
