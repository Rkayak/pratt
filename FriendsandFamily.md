This is the love of my life, my wife Rebecca. We first met on the ferry Malaspina that was headed for Sitka Alaska 26 Years ago. A year later we were married by Ships Captain John Hardin on the Far East Cruise. We have been truly blessed to be able to share our lives and adventures together. Our travels together have resulted in many close friendships which we cherish dearly. So if you see our vessel Rebecca Ann cruising in and around the Broughton Islands, or if you see someone in a Stearns inflatable kayak fighting a fish, that would be us.
