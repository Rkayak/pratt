	for as many rows as you need. Each column needs the image number put in twice once in the <a href=" and once in the

	<img src=" tag, and the title="" and alt="" need the same caption for the photo. You would change the

	notice the <center> tag pair, and the <h1> and <h2>. center is obvious, the other two are header sizes. h1 is the biggest.

Arrived, backed into our slip, and shut down the diesels for the summer in the Port of Edmonds. We did notice a lot of empty slips,
with no summertime renters.  All up the coast we observed fewer boats in most of the places that we visit every year. Economy is

We arrived in La Conner around 1:45 pm and fueled up at the Fuel Dock. With the current moving, and no help on the guest dock,

we were still able to pull up and tie off for the night.  We were relaxing on board, after walking down to our special Market to

pick up chicken and potato salad for dinner, when who should pop on board but, Marsha.  Bill was right behind her and they 

surprised us and were a very wonderful 'welcome home committee' of two. What a nice start to our return to the US. Thank you Bill

and Marsha.

Traveling south on the Vancouver Island side has been interesting and our first time going in this direction. We have learned of

new places to duck into in order to get out of building weather. Before heading into Seymour Narrows we had to wait for slack 

water. We pulled into a fishing camp called Brown Bay and tied up to the guest dock. We had a nice lunch and walked around the 

camp. Lots of small fishing boats were tied up to the docks and the campground was full. We left there and hit the rapids at 

Seymour Narrows at perfect slack. We tried to anchor in a logging lagoon named Menzies Bay, but we were not comfortable with all 

the logs laying around us. We continued on and found a marina called Discovery Harbor in Campbell River. Rebecca was able to 

contact our friend Ruth Montoya and we visited and had pizza for dinner with them. We stayed two nights at Discovery and left 

early to continue our journey back. The weather started picking up so we headed for Ford Cove on Hornby Island, and took shelter. 

It's an old government dock that is under construction. After rafting alongside another boat, Rebecca went kayaking. We had nice 

steaks for dinner and left early the next morning, hoping to reach Nanaimo; however, we only made it to French Creek. Wind picked 

up very quickly and with a following sea pushing us, we had enough for the day. French Creek is a active working fishing terminal 

and there was lots of activities going on. The next morning we went to the restaurant for breakfast but they were not open. We 

left French Creek and continued on to Nanaimo where we purchased fuel and anchored in Marks Bay. This evening we went back over 

to the Dingy Dock for fish and chips and we plan on leaving early in the morning for Dodd Narrows. Our current goal is to stop in

Clam Bay for overnight anchorage. Each day gets us closer to Edmonds and the reality that our summer is almost over.

Upon arrival at Lagoon Cove, we fueled up and then carefully slipped into the backside of the south dock on the inside of the

crab shack.  Hopefully pictures will show that with the wind blowing onshore, the nose of a boat sticking way out, and the narrowness

of the channel made for a challenging situation. Plus, we don't dare go to far forward, or the bow will end up kissing one of

Bill's rocks, and then he gets a little upset.  Doesn't like to have his underwater boulders scraped by boats! Then, the bakery

lady came in and parked under our bow! Those cinnamon buns are delicious, along with all of the other items you can see in the 

picture!  Her name is Jenny and she lives in Chatham Channel. Will verify shortly, but our understanding is that the name of her

baking business is Knight Inlet Outpost and she has a website at-> http://www.knightinletoutpost.com and then click on Bakery Boat.

Also, further information includes: Call ahead and have fresh baking prepared for your trip through the Broughtons or your passage south!  250-230-0509 minstrelisland@gmail.com

Bill always finds a place to put us, no matter how late we happen to show up in Lagoon Cove. This is the first time in our 38' that

we have parked on the back side of the crab shack, making sure we don't scratch any of Bill's rocks on shore, nor the one just 

under the surface that has a marker on it to make sure we miss coming up on it too far.

***We’ve reached that point in our cruising that we refer to as, "our starting to head back" mode. We go through the same thing every 

year but this year it seems to us that we would just like to ignore it and continue on with our wonderful travels up here in the

Broughton Archipelago, and further north, if time. Of course we both know that is not possible yet, but maybe some time in the 

near future that will happen. This has been a wonderful summer for us on the water. We’ve had our usual excitement of fishing, 

crabbing, and prawning while we’ve also had more than our share of rainy weather. We enjoyed having friends onboard and sharing 

companionship but we missed being able to spend more time with other boating friends because of unexpected happenings. The one 

thing that we have learned is that our time together is very precious and special. Rebecca has taught me to always try to be 

positive even when I’m grumbling about trying to locate and repair a mysterious symptom, and Rebecca continues to be Rebecca who 

always enjoys every single moment on the boat! Of course, we've already started planning our summer cruise for next year. Those

friends that we were not able to hook up with this year, we dearly hope to connect during the wintertime for some tentative

planning for the future.<br /><br />

	Now, in Sullivan Bay, it has been an exciting time for some spur of the moment fishing with Pete, Patrick and Chris.  Above are 

pictures highlighting the end results of being on the boat crabbing, fishing and prawning with the Petersons; showing what a team 

they are, in action. We went out a couple of times in our inflatable to Atkinson Island hoping to catch Lingcod or Halibut. Rebecca 

caught a 14 pound lingcod and a huge black rockfish. The black rockfish is the best eating and the most fun to catch. Chris and Pat

will testify that Rebecca actually thought she had a salmon on, even after she saw it flashing through the water. Chris caught his

biggest black rockfish on his fly rod which was very exciting for him. We all came home with caught fish, including some greenlings.

We woke up this morning to rain. This summer we have had more than enough rain but we're not complaining. After a nice breakfast 

we put on our rain gear and went out to check our prawn traps. We were rewarded with many large prawns and a 2 foot Gunnel which 

we turned loose. We rebaited the traps and came back to the boat to dry out. This afternoon we plan on reading books, on our 

Kindles while listening to the rain.

Alright, black bear on beach just off our stern.  Paddled closer to get some close up shots.  It sure was busy turning over rocks,

looking for things to eat. Yesterday morning we saw, much further down the beach, a black bear with her two little cubs.  All 

three of them were turning over rocks as well, to eat whatever they find edible. They also did quite a bit of digging in the mud

too. When we tried to paddle closer for a picture, the mama bear was very spooky and disappeared with her cubs before we could

get close enough.

Below the first picture is when we have come up Mackenzie Sound, prior to approaching Nimmo Bay.  It is a beautiful location and definitely

continuing rainy weather.  Remember a couple of weeks ago when we were looking for sunshine.  Well, we can honestly state, "It has

not yet arrived!" 	The next picture you can barely see Nimmo Lodge chalets with their incredible view out into MacKenzie Sound.

As we grew closer it becomes more obvious how picturesque the location and view of the chalets.  The 5th picture is the 

Nimmo Lodge which is located on docks.

We will be heading up to Big Nimmo Bay tomorrow, to visit with Larry and Trish.  Their floathome is now situated for the summer

and they are busy having fun around Nimmo Lodge: Trish with various gardening activities and Larry with just about any kind of 

project you could name to keep a large operation like Nimmo Lodge in top shape.	See you soon.

Rebecca went fishing today with Pete, and his grandson Patrick, and they caught an interesting conglomerate of fish.  They took 

pictures of a couple of varieties of flatfish, before releasing them quickly back, in order for Patrick to learn their differences.

So far, the best guess is that the first two pictures above are the front and back of a Dover Sole. The middle picture is of Patrick,

looking at the aft end of Atkinson Island.  The last two pictures above are calculated to be the front and back of a Rock Sole.

We have two delightful g-grandchildren at home who are spending time in different activities that we wanted to share with everyone.

Sophia is a charmer and, as you can see in the picture above, a beautiful little lady who turned one Feb 1st. Kenneth turned three

on April 24th and is very much the adventurer. David and Kazue have their hands full with this delightful young man. Kazue was able

to catch the two of them together in a really special black and white picture on a bench. The last picture shows Kenneth going full

speed ahead....and you know what...with Sophia working very hard to keep up with her older brother.  The two share a special relationship

and have really begun to care about each other.  Way to go, Kazue and David.  Thank you for sharing the pictures.

It was a delight to see Pete and Gail Peterson along with their two grandsons, Christopher and Patrick.  Gail was present when 

pictures were being taken but we were not able to catch her in action...Oops, never mind, I found her and a great picture too.  

She is one very busy grandmother and a wonderful person to stop and chat with. Christopher, and his Grandfather, went fishing for 

halibut this morning and came back with two. Christopher has the 'growth' problem of all fisherman.  Grandpa Pete stated to anybody 

that asked, the big one was 39 pounds.  As Rebecca was helping him learn to fillet halibut for the first time, people would stop 

and exclaim and then ask Christopher, 'How big?'  That halibut grew and became 40 pounds.  Who knows just how much it has grown at 

this point!  Way to go Christopher!

When we pulled anchor at Turnbull Cove, it was incredibly beautiful, as seen from the three pictures above.  We arrived at Sullivan 

Bay, again, and our welcoming committee was Chris.  He is a gracious host and we much appreciate his welcoming smile and his helping 

hand for coming into the docks.  One never knows which way the currents are moving and they can be really strong.  Then throw in 

the wind factor and the end result is, the more help, the better. Thank you Chris. Okay, it was really calm today and our 

timing was perfect for the current pushing us onto the dock. Just wanted to mention that is can be a challenge, some times. Thank

you Chris.

Our time with Alex, Dennis, and Kris regretfully ended this Friday at 5:30 a.m. with their early morning departure to cross Queen

Charlotte Straits. They needed to catch the high tide at Port McNeill in order to pull their boat out successfully and start down

island. <br /><br />



John made his famous sausage and egg burritos and we drank our last cup of coffee with our guests.  Rebecca put together

tri-tip sandwiches to tide them over until their next meal. They departed from Turnbull Cove and their next destination was Port 

McNeill.  The winds had dropped considerably and hopefully they had a smooth ride across the Straits. The guys were a pleasure to have onboard

and we miss their companionship.  The weather was not too friendly while they were here, with lots of nonstop raining, but that 

didn't stop us from fishing, prawning, and crabbing.  They left with a good supply of seafood in their freezer.

We did try trolling for salmon but it's just a little early yet for the run to start. By the end of the week, everyone was becoming

tired and, as seen in picture above, it was sit down to relax and read time.  Alex, as shown in the next picture, doesn't know the

meaning of the word, 'relax'.  He was busy on the swim platform cleaning crab he had just cooked (third picture). For a change in

activities, we walked the docks at Sullivan Bay looking at floathomes while taking care of some necessities that included fuel. In 

the evening, we had dinner at the Sullivan Bay restaurant. Their special for the night was 'Greek' dishes. Alex and Kris ordered 

that while Dennis, John, and Rebecca stuck with ribeye steak. When we left Sullivan Bay, there was a beautiful sunset.  In Turnbull

Cove, the 'Rebecca Ann' was easy to find due to anchor light (you have to look carefully in the picture).

We went on to Turnbull Cove to check out prawning, more crabbing, and some new fishing holes.  Have enjoyed the scenery, with 

one day of sunshine altogether, so far; since Alex and crew have arrived. Rebecca decided to go kayaking and in the process caught

the guys in action doing some serious crabbing with dropping and pulling five pots on a regular basis. Did okay in Turnbull but

Crabbing was fun in Claydon, even if it continued to rain nonstop.  As you can see, John received a bit of a wet shower from the 

overhead canvas that was helping keep the rest of us dry! John and Alex worked together raising the crab pots, while Dennis ran the

boat. We pulled some nice looking crabs for the guys, as you can see above. Alex did the cooking and they were delicious. Leaving

Claydon in the morning to go fishing at James Point, spotted a black bear on the beach.  Also saw another one, a day later while

pulling the crabpots.

Dennis, Alex, John and Rebecca went fishing outside Dickson Island in Alex's Offshore 24' Grady-White; a  very seaworthy vessel.

We had fun but it sure is a very rainy summer.  We then moved up to Claydon Bay with both boats to do some serious crabbing, in 

preparation for Kris' arrival.	He flew in early to Sullivan Bay and was sitting and waiting for us when we showed up after moving

up to Claydon Bay and putting out crabpots. Beautiful view from out new anchorage.

We were very sorry to hear that Garry is heading home early.  He has been great company and will miss him for the rest of the summer.

He has been feeling a bit under the weather and will go home and figure out what is going on.  Safe travel home Garry.  He will go to

Lagoon Cove tonight, then Squirrel Cove the following night, most likely Marks Bay the next night, and then home to Tacoma, WA on the final

day.  He tends to travel long legs each day.

Good morning everyone, getting ready to push off for Claydon Bay. Hopefully crabbing will be much better there. Where are those little puppies hiding anyway?!!! Heard from

boaters here at Lagoon Cove that they did pretty well at Waddington which is another special place to anchor and go out kayaking.  Lots to see.  Well, 

Broughton Archipelago, here we come.

This is the old office on the dock.  These guys purchased it from Bill and arrived on the 23rd to haul it off.  Ran into the buoy that anchors the end of the 'honeymoon' dock and could

see it actually moving the whole dock.  Bill came back out in his dinghy to supervise the guys moving the float and office, without taking his dock with them!

Left Matilpi at 11:00 a.m. and cruised slowly up Chatham Channel, through the Blowhole and tied up in Lagoon Cove.  We have to go 

through 'The Blowhole' which is right underneath Minstrel Island on the map.  Definitely nothing like the 'Hole-In-The-Wall' for 

entering and leaving the Octopus Islands, just have to be careful of the bull kelp especially since it is lowtide as we are passing through.<br /><br />

Left Big Bay at 8:45 a.m. and it was an absolutely perfect day with weather, tides and currents.  Went through Gillard Passage 

(it had just turned our direction) then the Dent Rapids and we moved along at our normal RPMs, but traveling one to two knots 

faster.  Went through Green Point Rapids and it was moving our direction at about 4 knots, we are really flying.  Water is calm, 

light breeze and so instead of Whirlpool Rapids and then staying the night in Forward Harbor, we continued straight down Chancellor 

Channel and then out to Current Passage and finally Johnstone Strait. Outgoing tide, SE breeze and flying along on the average of 

10 knots. WHEW! Very nice. Went up Havannah Channel and decided to check out the anchorage behind Matilpi Island right off an old 

midden.  Tried to anchor in 30 feet, but bottom dropped so quickly, we ended up in approximately 50 feet with a swing between 40 

and 65 feet. All secure by 2:45 p.m., a great day on the water!  In the evening, John spotted a black bear on the beach.  Our 

first for this summer.  The next morning, as we were enjoying coffee, THREE black bears walked out and were there for a short time.  

Something spooked them down the beach, before we could get our cameras. Dang!

As  you can see from the pictures below, we enjoyed raccoon company every day.  We were out and about, exploring the shoreline when we

spotted four raccoons on shore, digging for clams and whatever else they might find edible.  A big raccoon was also seen from our boat

digging a clam.  After it was dug up, the raccoon played 'juggle the clam' to the water, all the way to the water where he/she washed and 

then crunched clam shell and all with its teeth and down the hatch it swallowed the whole thing.  The last picture below was Rebecca

trying to catch clam squirts on the camera with our boat in the background.  No luck what so ever, on crabbing, so we pulled our hooks

and headed for Big Bay to catch some wi-fi time.

We crossed Georgia Straits with a southeasterly swell and a SE wind that pushed us northward. We pulled anchor at 4:45 a.m. and entered Georgia Strait by 5:05 am.  We dropped the hook in Squirrel Cove by 1:15 p.m.!

Actually made it from Marks Bay to Squirrel Cove in 8 1/2 hours! Plucked oysters at the low tide with Garry and then fried them up for dinner. Delicious!

The next day we headed north by 10:00 a.m. to catch slack waters at 12:40 pm for going through Hole-In-The-Wall. Hit it perfect. 

We then entered the Octopus Islands and found our usual anchorage.  Had to be careful entering the channel, due to low tide.

Good thing we keep a log book on board or wouldn't remember all the dates of traveling!

		Have a little story from this morning.  We were on our 2nd cup of coffee when we saw a guy in his sailboat pulling anchor behind us. After

watching for a bit, we saw his anchor was hooked on something really heavy.  He had a tripline attached to the anchor and had secured this line to a

winch on his mast, and was cranking it by hand.  The guy was getting frustrated and the next thing we saw was the handle to the winch go flying through

the air and "plop" into the water.  While we agonized for his situation, we did have a hard time not laughing at the comedy.  Turned out that his anchor

chain was wrapped around the concrete for a buoy, an engine block.....AND a refrigerator.  $100 later, a diver had unwrapped his chain.  The aforementioned

items were all wrapped together with their own chain. Hmmmm.....second thoughts about anchoring here!  Spoke with the man and he lost another anchor a

couple of days ago, on a sunken wreck, not too far from where we are currently anchored.  Anchors aweigh!	  Pictures below are from kayaking inside and

outside of Marks Bay, on the Georgia Strait side of Newcastle Island.

Wi-fi has been working well in picking up open signals, but yesterday's wide swinging on the hook kept making it drop the signal. It is slow this morning, but am up kind of early. :)<br /><br />

Okay, we are here in Marks Bay! Our 25th anniversary, as well.  Below are some pictures of happenings from Prevost Harbor to Marks Bay.

It was interesting, when we pulled into Bedwell Harbor to tie up to the Customs docks, one of them had obviously broke loose and was now

tied up to the dock we normally pulled in and tied up to.  Cleared customs with no problem, via a phone call at head of the dock.

Left La Conner at 6:15 this morning. Skies are overcast and cool. Water flat and will thread our way amongst the San Juan Islands to Prevost Harbor. More scenic route, somewhat shorter, and a lot more fun than going up around the top of all of the San Juans. 

We expect to meet Garry Marr in Prevost Harbor, (on Stuart Island) today and will drop a hook for the night.  Up early and an hour run over to Bedwell to check in to customs and the off to Nanaimo to fuel up.  Will then drop a hook over in Marks Bay. Hope to have wi-fi access to update website. :)

Weather and wind permitting, the following morning we will be up at 'O dark 30' to cross Georgia Straits.

Left Edmonds early, 7:00 am with the water like glass and currents going our way. Arrived at fuel dock, in La Conner at 12:25 pm and current was slack.  Very unusual to catch a time at the fuel dock without the 

current going strongly in one direction...or the other. Refueled and secure on the inside of the guest dock by 1 pm.  We had to walk up town to pick up a special order of potato salad.  Well worth the walk!  Off 

tomorrow for Prevost Harbor, Stuart Island prior to embarking into Canadian waters the following morning.  Will take a much needed R & R time for the rest of today.

		We will start the journey this year with our good friend Garry Marr. He continues to pilot his 43 Bayliner single-handed. 

				As in the past, Wi-Fi can be difficult in the Broughton Archipelago so we have to be very creative at times to stay in contact, plus upload as we travel.  Wish us luck. :)
