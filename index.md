### John and Rebecca...
first met on the morning of June 19th, 1985, on the Alaska Marine Highway ferry 'Malaspina' while cruising the inland passage to Sitka. John was traveling with his brother Bill while Rebecca was moving from Petersburg, to Sitka, with her sister Terry. (We won't identify younger and older!)
