# John & Rebecca Pratt's Nautical Adventures


## "Dock It" when you can...

### And here we go!

Before the summer begins, things come to an end... i.e. the school year, last little adventures and family time. Rebecca and her dear friend Sally are out on a bike ride. Check out those great smiles.  Biking adventures are planned for the fall. Also, the four GGs are growing quickly.

### Port of Poulsbo!

Cruising schedules and destinations are again, up in the air, due to Rebecca's school changes, continuing educational
training, and retirement plans. Meanwhile, we had the opportunity to have a dock that is empty of boats, go exploring and catch a few good pictures, and zzzzz's. Ran into a few old salty mates, but they weren't much for conversation.

### Port of Port Townsend

An interesting harbor to enter, on a good day; but more challenging when looking for slip that was assigned VHF radio conversation.  Oh, and also on one of the lowest, low tide days of the entire year. Did I mention the breeze, it was puffing around 14 kph with little gusts that added to the challenge of manueverability.  Anyway... looking for "C" dock; okay found it; now slip #154.  Hmmm... down this row? Nope, back up, watch for the wind pushing boat sideways to cattywampers sideways as you are backing up.  Not too bad, next row is not as wide, still no number 154; must be on dock closest to shore.  Okay, down this row, which is very narrow by the way... hmmmm..... there are boats in every slip, including #154. OK, Houston, we have
a little problem. Revving up the engines to stay in control of the boat while backing up in this narrow alley. Whew! NOW, where to dock?  Too busy keeping boat away from all other boats to call the harbormaster.  Pulled up on the outside of the outermost "C" dock and friendly guy came down to help us catch our lines and tie off.  Breeze was very helpful in pushing boat away from the dock.  Not quite the kind of help what we were asking for, but it all worked out in the end, thanks to the friendly guy, Roland.  Went up to check in and find out where they wanted us to move to and were told we could stay where we were for a couple of nights. Afterwards, we walked to the "Blue Moose" and had breakfast with Roland.

### Western Flyer

On the walk back from breakfast, Roland walked us into one of the huge butler buildings that they are working on boats in and showed us a boak right out of one of John Steinbeck's books, "Sea of Cortez" that is being restored.

### Rainbow in Port Townsend

Early evening visiting with Roland and while sitting on his boat, a full rainbow display was our highlight of a perfect day.

### Solar Panel powered boat!!!

What in the world? Haven't quite figured out all the components on this boat, but looks like it is powered by solar panels, and/or a rower; or some combination thereof. There were many unique boats on the hardtop, way too many to give justice to and so caught a few other unique looking boat pics.

### Time with Paul

Spending time with our friend Paul was a blessing.  His doctor reports are encouraging and he continues to keep an upbeat attitude. As his daughter Tina says, "He is like the energizer bunny that just keeps going, and going, and going!" Everyone who knows Paul, are in complete agreement. We also had a chance to visit with Tina as well, as she came over to see her dad on one of the days that we were still hanging around PT.

### And on to Langley...

An unexpected stop occurred when the wind came up and a discussion ensued on whether to continue on for 20+ more miles
to either Oak Harbor, or La Conner; or try to find a place to 'duck out' of the stiffening breeze that was nearby.  Having heard good things regarding Langley, from several fellow boaters back at the home port dock, we decided to check it out. We just happened to be passing it off our port side. After a phone call to the harbormaster and a sharp left turn we were safely secured on the inside dock.  The view is amazing, with a nice breeze that keeps things cooler when the sun's out and no clouds in the sky. Moorage fee, including power and wifi, is one of the best deals we have found thus far. After five years, the modem for our wireless system on the boat died.  The Rogue Wave Company overnighted a new one and we picked it up at the post office where it arrived as a General Delivery. We called the Post Office in Langley, to give them a heads up that we were expecting a package.  Took two minutes to attach it and we were back in business.

### The Glass Fish and long hill UP to Langley

Plenty to see and do in town. Rebecca made sure that we exercised daily. She always finds the highest hills, 
though! The first picture is a photo of the hill we climb to go into town. It is good exercise but there are a few problems. Once we reach downtown Langley, we have to walk past coffee shops, chocolate shops, ice cream shops and.... are you getting the picture?!!! Exercise is futile! Or so it would appear! LOL. We always keep our eyes peeled for fish in our travels, and we found some real beauties, on land! Glassy ones sure do sparkle in the sun, that's for sure.

### Rascals about...Langley

Walking around town, we happened to meet up with local folks, along with the local wildlife.  One person shared that some of the little critters were escapees from a recent fair! Taking daily walks we stopped and chatted with different local people and they were all equally friendly and full of tidbits about the town. Very friendly environment.

### 4th of July in La Conner

On the fourth we were again treated to a spectactular fireworks display courtesy of The Nations.  We saw it last year and, if possible, it was even better this year. The few extra days we spent in La Conner was well worth the stay. Having the super wifi in Langley allowed Rebecca to continue to work on school assignments, plus catch up on preparing her work for the monthly church newsletter.  Losing vice principals at her school is a set back, but only temporary because Rebecca has worked hard to keep her department second to none. While in La Conner, we also make sure to get our annual dosage of chicken strips and homemade potato salad.

### Fossil Bay in Sucia Island

After leaving La Conner we headed north again but unsure of our next destination.  Crabbing and fishing are closed 
currently, but kayaking and exploring is open.  We took a chance and headed to one of our old haunts from years past, on Sucia Island.  After looking over the options, we decided to check out a new bay for the first time. We currently are located in Fossil Bay with about 30 other boaters that are either on oneof the 15 mooring buoys, anchored, or tied up at one of the two docks.  The San Juan Islands are one of the Washington State's premiere vacation locations. Of course it's always very crowded, but very beautiful.  Since there is no fishing nor crabbing, camping, hiking and kayaking are the number one activities. Years ago this was our favorite destination, until we went into Canada and visited the Princess Louisa Inlet after going through the Malibu Rapids.

### West Sound Marina

It is important to call ahead to reserve a spot on the guest dock. We called from Fossil Bay to see if they had room and made a reservation for the next day. When we arrived, we called and they let us know that we needed to stand off for a bit while a big sailboat was getting ready to pull away from the fuel dock. It was low tide and apparently, where we needed to pull in was pretty shallow. Plus, the wind was blowing so that you had to keep the boat close to the other boats already tied to the dock, in order to not drift sideways into the shallow water. Hmmm... This was getting interesting, not to mention that the breeze was pretty stiff. We drifted for awhile, amidst some mini sailers learning how to handle their little skiffs.  Just about ready to drop an anchor when the big sailboat pulled out.  A couple minutes later a large inflatable pulled out from the fuel dock as well. When he went by us, he slowed down and said it was really shallow waters. There were two boats that we would have to pass by closely, and the 2nd boat put out fenders on the water side.  We decided to go for it because the wind was dropping some, and when we came in we hugged the boats pretty close. Wind was picking up again very quickly, so when we got to the dock it was really nice to see three people standing by to catch our lines. There is only one guest dock, which can hold up to three or four big boats, depending on how tight they are squeezed (tucked) together.  We visited with the couple on the boat 'Seacoaster', Jane and Tom (they were on the boat with the extra fenders out, which we rubbed on as we came in) and we hope to see them again. Rebecca and Jane did a lowtide kayak ride and had a great time. Yes, Rebecca did put on her life vest.

It is hard to describe the melange of boats in this marina.  Big boats, little boats, racing sailboats, the Polar Express amongst a few!

### East Sound visit

We decided to visit East Sound using the Transit bus, plus we needed to figure out why we were not able to upload our website updates. Bus ride was fun with a long ride all over Orcas Island. Turns out that the majority of the roads (all of them we think) are windy twisty-turny and very narrow. We were picked up at the West Sound Marina and rode over to the west side of Orcas with first destination, Deer Harbor. (At $5 a foot for dockage, not quite our price range.) We then rode back by West Sound Marina before continuing on to East Sound. We did not get off the bus at this point so that we could see the east side of the island, from land. It was a longer (still very narrow and windy) ride to Rosario Resort and then on to Cascade Lake before turning around and heading back to East Sound. At this point we got off the bus and went to the Brown Bear for java and a sticky bun. Next stop was a quick rest stop and then we had noticed a local computer store, Orcas Online, and stopped to share a computer challenge. Very nice gentleman looked over the problem and then said the guy with the expertise had just stepped out to get a sandwich and would be back in 30 minutes, or less. We decided to do a little shopping and so we walked back over to the main grocery store that the Transit Bus had dropped us off in front of earlier. Picked up everything we needed, except perisables and then tried to decide how to handle catching the bus at 1:30 pm or waiting for the expert to return from lunch and catch the 3:15 pm bus. Other problem was we had two BIG bags full to the top with groceries and Rebecca still had her computer bag as well. Executive decision, John on the bus and Rebecca catches the 3:15 pm bus. Time sure flies when all of a sudden there are constraints! Rick was very helpful at Orcas Online and then Rebecca went up to the library to finish uploading the data for the website that was ready. Oh, almost forgot. After leaving East Sound, the Transit Bus heads for the Ferry in Olga before turning around, again, and heading towards the west side of Orcas Island. Next stop, West Maring Sound. Now, we are back on the boat and 'as happy as a clam at high water' or, in this case... two clams at high water! Sure is good to be home.

### San Juan Island, Garrison Bay

We left West Sound around 7:00 am Sunday and traveled to Garrison Bay to meet up with folks we met at West Sound Marina. Before we left the dock, we met one of the locals!  See pictures below.  We plan on crabbing for a few days. Shouldn't tell you this but corned venison, cabbage, spuds, onions, etc for dinner tonight. Ouch. Traveling to new places, it is always good to know someone the first time you are there. They always have insight and knowledge that helps you feel much more comfortable, especially when dropping a hook. Coming up around the north end of San Juan Island we met (went through) Spieden Channel for the first times. We were catching the current going our way coming up the east side of San Juan Island and were expecting pretty much the same through the Channel. Whoops... Got up to 13 plus mph when our standard speed was an average of 7 mph! Good thing we timed it to not have to go against this current.  Hung a left and went through Roche Harbor, the engines were idling and we still moved along at a good clip.  Halfway down Mosquito Pass (on the other end of Roche Harbor) we hung a sharp left while watching the channel buoys, and other boats, closely. Little winding passage but very doable.  We passed Horseshoe Bay on our starboard side and then entered Garrison Bay, also on starboard side.  Even though there are a lot of boats anchored in here (counted 25 just in Garrison Bay) it is a very nice location. Hope mosquitos stay out in the Pass. :)  Dropped a couple of crabpots after visiting with Tom and Jane on the Seacoaster (new friends we made at West Sound). Will pull in a little while. They did ok yesterday but nothing to dance on top of the water about.

### Garrison Bay wildlife

Couple days crabbing and then we had to pull all the pots for the two days of the week that crabbing is closed. Went out exploring Garrison Bay netting some good pictures of the British 'English Camp' along with the royal Jack flying.  To the right it appears to be an old graveyard. Along one beach, back in the bay there was a momma raccoon and her three half-grown rugrats! Interestingly enough, the kits really got into eating (playing with) a big red jellyfish; you know, the kind that stings like crazy on our flesh! It is always interesting seeing what happens at a very low tide and as one can see, the owners of the two boats have it down to a science, high and dry!  Further along, on the west side of Garrison Bay and again at low tide, the seals and their babies are warming up in the sun.  Floating by quietly, were able to get several good pictures of them, as well.

### Roche Harbor to Friday Harbor

We needed to run the boat for a bit, to clean the intake scupper for the genset, so we decided to pull anchor and move. We couldn't crab anyway.  Ran the boat at regular speed, after clearing Mosquito Passage and Roche Harbor, for about 30 minutes and when we stopped we could see that there was some improvement of water through the intake scupper.  We anchored in Roche Harbor, near the docks amidst a lot of boats. It is very interesting the number of BIG boats that tie up in Roche Harbor Marina. Next morning we decided to move on to Friday Harbor so that Rebecca could get some work done that she needed on-line access in order to complete. The following pictures show our location in the harbor and we have a front seat to the main entrance and get to watch boats all day coming and going.  In the afternoon the wind picked up and boats were challenged getting their 40 foot plus boats in to the slip without scraping the barnacles off the boat next to  them.  Even had one boat that used our dinghy as a fender, swinging around in the wind! All's well.  We also had a diver check our bottom, to make sure everything is ok. Looks good and we are ok until we haul out the boat at the beginning of August to clean the bottom and repaint. What? Work, while on vacation? Oh well. Gotta do what ya gotta do!
