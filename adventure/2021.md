# John & Rebecca Pratt's Nautical Adventures


## 2021 - Summer of changes

### Do we need masks?

Jumping off for the summer 'after' Covid-19, with a bang.  Rebecca has retired officially from teaching. After 27 years, it was time to pursue new avenues of adventures. Starting with getting on our boat and relaxing, we packed up and left for salty waters.  Originally we were hoping to head for the Inside Passage in Canada; however, the border is 
still not open.  Guess we will explore Puget Sound. That being said, Rebecca hopped on her retirement gift, Lectric Bike, and headed off for the Edmonds area and beach. We had the additional blessing of meeting Arden and Rhonda for dinner, and lots of hip boot conversations.  We also got to hang out with our next door neighbor on the dock, Rich, and another good friend Mark (no picture). Will get one!  Also, the view from the end of our dock, is always a breath of fresh air.

### Poulsbo

First destination was Poulsbo.  Oops, not only did we hit the heat wave, it was cussing hot and over 100 degrees with no breeze; and on top of that, the wifi in the Port of Poulsbo (POP) was abysmal. Have heard that the POP does not want to spend the money for a reasonable but consistent service for their guest and permanent moorers.  Grrr...  Needless to say, we are more hesitant returning to this less than idylic location.
